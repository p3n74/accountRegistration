in the database, user_credentials
contain a JSON datatype for the list
of attended events, that way we can efficiently
store a list


appending new events to the list of a user

we just do this query

UPDATE user_credentials
SET attendedevents = JSON_ARRAY_APPEND(attendedevents, '$', 4)
WHERE uid = 101;

this will append 4 to the list. substitute it for a
variable when implemented


fror the attended events, which will be needed
we need to use JSON extract to individually
 
Extract the event by index

SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(attendedevents, '$[0]')
FROM user_credentials
WHERE uid = 101;  -- Replace with the actual user ID

Create a table of all attended events of a user

SELECT e.eventid, e.eventname, e.startdate, e.enddate, e.location, e.eventinfopath
FROM user_credentials u
JOIN events e ON JSON_CONTAINS(u.attendedevents, JSON_ARRAY(e.eventid))
WHERE u.uid = 3;

Create a list of all paths to the attended events'
badges

SELECT e.eventbadgepath FROM user_credentials u 
JOIN events e ON JSON_CONTAINS(u.attendedevents, JSON_ARRAY(e.eventid))
WHERE u.uid = 3;
